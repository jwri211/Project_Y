# Project_Y
Change the world with emerging technology research during an IT fundamentals course. Y not?

Add ideas for our group project in this readme. Any idea goes!  

> Today we talked about the idea of using an NFT(non-fungible token) to verify experience.
> A digital, encrypted, unique identifier on the blockchain verifying qualifications, experience, character reference.
> Can be as a physical badge, "dogtags", information accessible via phone app or browser.
> Can set information to be private, public, only you authorise who has it.
> Hold bank account information in a secure place, access to finances.
> Access to personal health information.
> Workplaces are authorised to add experience to your token based on hours worked.
> education facilities can add exp to your token based on courses completed.
> qualifications like degrees and diplomas are digitaly represented.

>PROS:
>Based on block chain technology for authentication
>Your time is your most valuable resource, prove you have used it with absolute accuracy.
>Secure your personal information with 100% authenticity.
>Experience is provable! 
>Recruiters have a clear idea of the experience of potential employers.
>Choose what information is private and which is public.
>Can hold easily accessible health information for use in medical emergency - one tap patient information allergies, medication taken, etc.
>Clear proof of ownership

>CONS:
>All your digital eggs are in one big, digital basket.
>Prone to loss or damage.
>Harder to prove soft skills: - teamwork, communication.
>Physical security can be manipulated depending on the format of the token. Can I steal a token with access to sensitive data?
>Can the data be smudged by unethical authorisers?
>Can you use the token to review other people or places: recommend/don't recommend

>SOCIAL AND ORGANISATIONAL RAMIFICATIONS:
>Single, unmutable and infallible form of identification.
>Qualifications, work experience and licensing are held in one place.
>Social and hobby experience can be recorded towards 'soft skills'
>Experience is now transparant and provable: Six years automotive engineering experience is not fakeable
>Experience *givers* must be authorised by the appropriate agency meaning no one can give out experience for time not spent or tasks not done.
>Honesty about a persons activities.
>Helpful when recruiting staff to find the best person for a position. 
>Help in identifying the best roles for individuals within a society or organisation
